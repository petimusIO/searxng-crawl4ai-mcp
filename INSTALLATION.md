# 🚀 SearXNG + Crawl4AI MCP Installation Guide

## Quick Install Commands for Claude Code

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> firecrawl-mcp-custom
cd firecrawl-mcp-custom
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Start Docker Services
```bash
# Preflight check - ensure searxng settings file is correct
./scripts/check-searx-config.sh

# Start all services (SearXNG, Crawl4AI, Redis)
docker compose up -d

# Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8081/search?q=test&format=json  # SearXNG
curl http://localhost:8001/health                      # Crawl4AI
```

> Note: `./searxng-settings.yml` must be a regular **file** (not a directory). If a directory is bind-mounted to `/etc/searxng/settings.yml`, the SearXNG container will fail to start and may enter a restart loop.

### 3. Configure Claude Code MCP

Add this to your Claude Code MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng-crawl4ai": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/firecrawl-mcp-custom",
      "env": {
        "PROXY_URL": "http://username:password@your-proxy-server.com:10000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/firecrawl-mcp-custom` with your actual path!

### 4. Optional: Without Proxy
If you don't want to use the rotating proxy, simply remove the env section:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng-crawl4ai": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/firecrawl-mcp-custom"
    }
  }
}
```
